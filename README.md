#Janes Flowers
Just a small static flower shop to pratice basic react skills again. I think later on I will come back and update to UI to something more modern and add in a store with stripe but that might take me a couple of weeks before I get to it.

no one to install it if you dont want to I pushed a live demo with surge

###Installing
If you do wish to install it, I bootstraped with create-react-app, default scripting is as follows:

`npm start`
Will run the app in development mode.<br>
Opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser.
