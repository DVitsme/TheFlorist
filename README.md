# Janes Flowers
Just a small static flower shop to pratice some basic react skills. I have plans like to come back and update to UI and add in a store with stripe but that might take me a couple of weeks before I get to it. 

## See the Site

No need to clone the repo if you dont want to.

### Installing
If you do wish to install it, I bootstraped with create-react-app, default scripting is as follows:

`npm start`
Will run the app in development mode.<br>
Opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser.
